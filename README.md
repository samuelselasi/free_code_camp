# [1. Responsive Web Design](./responsive_web_design)
##### In this `Responsive Web Design` Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: `HTML` (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and `CSS` (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.
##### First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of `HTML` and `CSS`. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like `CSS variables` by building a `penguin`, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.
##### Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with `Flexbox`, and a magazine article layout with `CSS Grid`.
